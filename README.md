The two witches set out on a journey to save the princess, and along the way they encounter many challenges as they must avoid meadows and kill evil monsters, and collect magical items to increase the speed of their bullets. However, it seems that some monsters don't want to hurt them......

### CONTROLLER: 
Player 1 uses the Key W to move up, Key S to move down and Shift to attack

* Collect as many magic items as possible as this will boost the speed of your attacks.
